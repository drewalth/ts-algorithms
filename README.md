# ts-algorithms

A collection of algorithms in TypeScript. Inspired by [swift-algorithms](https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms).

> This is a work in progress and not all algorithms are implemented yet. And an NPM package is not yet published.

## Functions

- `chunked` - Chunk an array into smaller arrays of a given size.
- `chunkedBy` - Chunk an array into smaller arrays based on a predicate.
- `chunkedOn` - Chunk an array into smaller arrays based on a projection.
- `evenlyChunked` - Chunk an array into smaller arrays as evenly as possible.
- `stridingBy` - Stride an array by a given size.
- `uniqued` - Remove duplicate elements from an array.
- `uniquedOn` - Remove duplicate elements from an array based on a projection.
- `lazyUniqued` - A lazy sequence that removes duplicate elements from a base sequence.
- `lazyUniquedOn` - A lazy sequence that removes duplicate elements from a base sequence based on a projection.
- `minMax` - Find the minimum and maximum elements in an array.
- `minMaxComparable` - Find the minimum and maximum elements in an array of comparable values.
